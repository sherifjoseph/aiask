DESCRIPTION
    Automatically captures context up to the point of an error in a Stata `.do` file, sends 
    the context to ChatGPT, and retrieves suggestions for resolving the error. Allows users 
    to specify which variables' context to include or to use all variables by default.

OPTIONS

        to run the chatgpt_context command.

    VARIABLES(varlist)
        Specifies which variables' context (metadata, summary stats) to include in the 
        query. If not specified, all variables will be included.

    UPTOERROR
        Automatically detects the most recent error in the Stata log and uploads the context 
        up to that point to ChatGPT.
